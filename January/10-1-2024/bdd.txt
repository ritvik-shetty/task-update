# What is Cucumber Framework

It is an opensource software testing framework in which we write testcases which everyone can understand easily i.e non-technical as well. It accepts tests written in Gherkin Language.


#  Cucmber Test automation Uses files:

It uses mainly two files i.e the feature file and step definition file .
  The feature file consists of code written in Gherkin language eg plain english
  The Step Definition file consists the code written by the developers.

# Installation steps:
1) Install any IDE for python 
2) Use the command pip install behave to install the behave module 

#  Steps to be followed in Cucumber:

1) Feature File : It has a .feature extension. The test are written here in plain text (Given When and Then to define test scenarios)
2) Step Definition: It defines the steps and actions that need to be executed for each step in the feature file i.e the code
3) Test Runner File: Helps to execute the feature files and coordinates each step of the feature file to corresponding step definition.


# Benefits of BDD:

1)Defining behavior is more important here than tests.
2)Can be easily written by even non technical person.
3)Helps in proper communication between the DEV team and testing team.
4)Provides quality code.

#  Limitations of BDD:
1) Testers must have prior experience in TDD(Test Driven Development).
2) Requirements must be correctly analyzed.


# example scenario:

Given the user has entered invalid credentials
When the user clicks the submit button
Then display the proper validation message


#  Tags in cucmber are used if we have many scenarios in the feature file and we need to keep them in one group.(@ symbol is used)
