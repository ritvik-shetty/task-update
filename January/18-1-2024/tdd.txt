# TDD is development of tests before adding a feature in code. First we add the test before adding the functionality in our code, then make sure that the functionality will work.

# Steps:
    1) Write a failing unit test
    2) Make the unit test pass
    3) Repeat

# Benefits of TDD:
    1) In TDD tests are built before adding any new feature into it. Thatâ€™s a great benefit of TDD as the entire code has test coverage.
    2) In TDD one should have a target before adding new functionality i.e before adding any new functionality one should be clear about its outcome.
    3) The final application will be less buggy as the entire code is covered by the test. 

# Acceptance Test Driven Development:
    In ATDD a user, business manager and developer all are involved.
    1) First, they discuss what the user wants in his product.
    2) The business manager creates sprint stories for the developer.
    3) The developer writes tests before starting the projects and then starts coding.
    4) Every product/software is divided into small modules, so the developer codes for the very first module then test it.
       If the test passes and the code are working as per user requirements, it is moved to the next user story,
       otherwise some changes are made in coding or program to make the test pass.    

# eg)
    First we write a test case for get request. When we run the testscript it will through an error as the url doesn't exist
    Now we implement the API code. 
    Again we run the testscript. (Repeat)
